* Device tree binding for CPU boost frequency (aka over-clocking)

Certain CPU's can be operated in optional 'boost' mode (or sometimes referred as
overclocking) in which the CPU can operate at frequencies which are not
specified by the manufacturer as CPU's operating frequency.

Optional Properties:
- boost-frequencies: list of frequencies in KHz to be used only in boost mode.
  This list should be a subset of frequencies listed in "operating-points"
  property. Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/opp.txt for
  details about "operating-points" property.

Example:

	cpus {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		cpu@0 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			compatible = "arm,cortex-a9";
			reg = <0>;

			operating-points = <
				1500000 1350000
				1400000 1287500
				1300000 1250000
				1200000 1187500
				1100000 1137500
				1000000 1087500
			>;
			boost-frequencies = <1500000 1400000>;
		};
		cpu@1 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			compatible = "arm,cortex-a9";
			reg = <1>;
		};
	};
