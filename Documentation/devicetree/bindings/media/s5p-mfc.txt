* Samsung Multi Format Codec (MFC)

Multi Format Codec (MFC) is the IP present in Samsung SoCs which
supports high resolution decoding and encoding functionalities.
The MFC device driver is a v4l2 driver which can encode/decode
video raw/elementary streams and has support for all popular
video codecs.

Required properties:
  - compatible : value should be either one among the following
	(a) "samsung,mfc-v5" for MFC v5 present in Exynos4 SoCs
	(b) "samsung,mfc-v6" for MFC v6 present in Exynos5 SoCs
	(c) "samsung,mfc-v7" for MFC v7 present in Exynos5420 SoC
	(d) "samsung,mfc-v8" for MFC v8 present in Exynos5800 SoC

  - reg : Physical base address of the IP registers and length of memory
	  mapped region.

  - interrupts : MFC interrupt number to the CPU.
  - clocks : from common clock binding: handle to mfc clock.
  - clock-names : from common clock binding: must contain "mfc",
		  corresponding to entry in the clocks property.

Optional properties:
  - samsung,power-domain : power-domain property defined with a phandle
			   to respective power domain.

  - memory-region : from reserved memory binding: phandles to two reserved
	memory regions: accessed by "left" and "right" mfc memory bus
	interfaces, used when no SYSMMU support is available
  - memory-region-names : from reserved memory binding: must be "left"
	and "right"

Example:
SoC specific DT entry:

mfc: codec@13400000 {
	compatible = "samsung,mfc-v5";
	reg = <0x13400000 0x10000>;
	interrupts = <0 94 0>;
	samsung,power-domain = <&pd_mfc>;
	clocks = <&clock 273>;
	clock-names = "mfc";
};

Board specific DT entry:

codec@13400000 {
	memory-region = <&mfc_left>, <&mfc_right>;
	memory-region-names = "left", "right";
};
